# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer
1. Scripts with type="module" are loaded with the defer attribute by default. Therefore, they are executed after the HTML document has been fully parsed.

2. Allows us to use `import` and `export` statements, enabling better code organization and reusability.
