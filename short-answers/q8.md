# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer
When we say "semantic elements", we're referring to using HTML elements that clearly convey the purpose of their content to both the browser and the developer. Semantic elements provide a descriptive structure to the web page.
An example of a semantic element would be the `<nav>` element. It represents a section of navigation links. 
A non-semantic element would be a `<div>`. It has no real meaning beyond grouping together other elements.
