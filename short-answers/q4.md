# Question
Explain what the following status codes mean. Don't just copy and paste the default status text, tell us in your own words what the codes are for.

# Answer

1. 200 - The client's request was successful.

2. 404 - The client's request was unsuccessful because the server cannot find the requested source. This often occurs because of an issue on the client's end (for example, writing a typo when fetching something.)

3. 500 - The client's request could not be fulfilled due to an error on the server side.
