# Question

What is the danger behind inserting user entered information *directly* into the DOM unescaped?

# Answer
Inserting user entered information directly into the DOM without escaping it is dangerous due to the potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. XXS attacks allow attackers to insert malicious code into webpages; this code can then steal sensitive user information.
